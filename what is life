Nobel laureate Erwin Schrödinger's What is Life?
Nobel laureate Erwin Schr dinger's What is Life?


The question “what is life?” may seem an absurd one, as it is somewhat obvious, given how deep one wishes to go.
It is likely that, in asking the question “what is life?”, we are looking to dig a little deeper into “this” to find out more about what life is.
The intent of this website is to focus on these questions and to provide some insight into how to better understand the nature of reality, what part we do (or can) play, the principles or natural laws (if any) that govern this reality, and what the whole point of living is.

Life is the aspect of existence that processes, acts, reacts, evaluates, and evolves through growth (reproduction and metabolism).
The crucial difference between life and non-life (or non-living things) is that life uses energy for physical and conscious development.
Or is the question, ‘What is the meaning (purpose) of life?’ That’s a real tough one.
But I think that the meaning of life is the ideals we impose upon it, what we demand of it.
So our natural intuitions determine the meaning of life for us; and it seems for other species as well, for those intuitions resonate through much of life and give it its purpose.
Life exists at many levels.
Yet life is only a story, so it can act only through matter.
Therefore life is by nature a toolmaker.
So why do humans risk undermining the life of which they are part?
Yet humans, the ‘tool-making animals’, are themselves tools of life, in an unplanned experiment.
But what is life really about, if anything?
Life is the embodiment of selfishness!
Life is selfish because it is for itself in two ways: it is for its own survival, and it is for its own reproduction.
In our scientific age, we look to the biologists to define ‘life’ for us.
Non-sentient organisms live, but they do not know life.
Third, in the scientific definition, there is no place for life having value.
However, many would say that life has value in its own right – that it is not simply that we humans value life and so give it value, but that it has value intrinsically.
Fourth, there is the question of life as a whole having a purpose or goal.
I believe there is a hierarchy of living beings from the non-sentient, to the sentient, to humans, and perhaps up to God. When I ask, ‘What is life?
I want to know what life is at its highest form.
I believe life at its best is spirit: it is active, sentient, feeling, thinking, purposive, valuing, social, other-respecting, relating, and caring.
But if life is just a journey from womb to tomb, will such ‘meaning’ be sufficient to allow the traveller at journey’s end to feel that it was worthwhile?
These are physical and emotional needs, which, when enough of them are met, ensure the health of the individual, maximising his or her ability to achieve meaning in life.
• And yes – to have meaning in one’s life
Animal life (excluding that of humans) shows that life is a simple matter of being, by means of a modest routine of eating, sleeping and reproducing.
Life has lost its purpose because we have tried to give it one.
In that moment you are feeling life as it should be.
For that is what life is.
Of all Webster’s definitions of ‘life’, the one for me that best covers it is, “the sequence of physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual.” Indeed, life is a continuum of accomplishment, failure, discovery, dilemma, challenge, boredom, sadness, disappointment, appreciation, the giving and receipt of grace, empathy, peace, and our reactions to all sorts of stimuli – touch, love, friendship, loss… One can either merely exist or try to achieve, working through the difficult times, perhaps learning a thing or two.
It’s a matter of weighing the good and bad times – the challenge is to balance both, ending up with a life looked back on that was worth the mighty effort.
Life is thus a constant process of becoming, through creating values and meaning.
Life is the consciousness of humanity; it is perception of the world and the universe.
Life is suffering and destruction.
But life is also happiness; life is living.
Life is joy and creativity.
For some, life is God. We would all then be His children.
Life is: being conscious of yourself and others; a being with a soul; experience; what you make it; your chance to be a success; family; living as long as you can; not being dead; greater than the sum of its parts; complex chemical organisation; different things to different people; a mystery; a journey; don’t know; a quote from a song, “baby don’t hurt me”; life begins after death.
I was surprised to find that I had no immediate definition of life myself (hence the idea to ask) and that there is no consensus (only one reply was repeated), but then, that also is life.
Now we know what life is, the next question is, How Should I Live?
